# Nitinol Lotus Flower: Interactive Air Quality Sensor 

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the intersection of **architecture, environmental monitoring, and responsive design** by creating a **Nitinol-based kinetic sculpture** that reacts to **VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) and PM2.5** levels in indoor spaces. Instead of traditional digital air quality displays, this **biomimetic installation** provides a sensory experience, enhancing occupant awareness and well-being.

## 🎯 Key Features
- **Air Quality Monitoring**: Reads VOC and PM2.5 levels from pre-recorded sensor data (CSV format).
- **Interactive Kinetic Response**: Uses **Nitinol shape memory alloy** to open/close a lotus flower sculpture in response to air quality changes.
- **Human-Centered Design**: Inspired by **biomimicry**, offering an intuitive, non-digital representation of environmental data.
- **Python & Arduino Integration**: Uses an **Arduino Portenta H7** with a Vision Shield SD card module to read sensor data and control a heating pad.
- **Cross-Disciplinary Research**: Merges **architecture, psychology, IoT, and environmental science** to explore responsive design.

## 🛠 Installation & Setup
### **Hardware Requirements**
- **Arduino Portenta H7** (with Vision Shield for SD card support)
- **Heating pad** (5V safe operation)
- **Nitinol wire** 
- **SD card** (for storing sensor data)
- **Power Supply** (5V for safe operation)
- **Soldering Kit & Wiring** (for hardware connections)

### **Software Requirements**
- **Arduino IDE** (for flashing the Portenta H7)
- **Python 3.8+** (for data pre-processing)
- **Pandas** (for CSV handling)
- **RPi.GPIO** (for Raspberry Pi implementation, if applicable)

---

## 🚀 Usage Instructions
### **1. Hardware Setup**
- Connect the **heating pad** to the **Arduino Portenta H7** via GPIO pin **9**.
- Insert the **SD card** into the Vision Shield with **VOC sensor data stored in `voc_sensor_11.csv`**.
- Ensure all **wiring is secured**, and the device is powered via USB or an external 5V source.

### **2. Uploading Code to Arduino**
- Open **Arduino IDE**.
- Install necessary libraries (`SD.h`, `SPI.h` for SD card reading).
- Upload the provided **Arduino sketch** (`main.ino`) to the Portenta H7.

### **3. Running the Python Script (Optional for Data Analysis)**
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Run the script to analyze CSV sensor data:
  ```bash
  python analysis_script.py
  ```

## 📜 Code Explanation
### **Arduino Code (Heating Pad Activation)**
- Reads **VOC data** from `voc_sensor_11.csv` on the **SD card**.
- If VOC levels exceed **600 ppm**, **activates heating pad** to shape-change the **Nitinol Lotus Flower**.
- Runs in a **loop**, resetting to the start of the CSV once completed.

### **PythonCode**
- Uses **Pandas** to read **CSV sensor data**.
- Logs VOC levels over time.
- Outputs analysis of **VOC-PM2.5 correlation**.


### **Scientific Basis**
- **VOC & PM2.5 Correlation**: Secondary Organic Aerosols (SOA) formation is influenced by humidity levels.
- **Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) Mechanics**: Nitinol responds to **heat**, enabling mechanical actuation based on IAQ metrics.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

Arduino Issues
- SD Card Not Detected → Check wiring, reformat the SD card to FAT32, ensure correct CS pin.
- No VOC Data Readings → Confirm voc_sensor_11.csv is correctly formatted with integer values.
- Heating Pad Not Responding → Check power supply, connections, and threshold logic in the code.
- Flutter App Issues
- Flutter not found? → Install Flutter SDK: flutter.dev
- App crashes on startup? → Run flutter doctor to check dependencies.
- No data logs? → Ensure Firebase/Local Storage is configured correctly.
